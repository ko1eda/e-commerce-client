# Front end of e-commerce platform built with Nuxt.js

> Note: This application is still in the early stages of development, for the latest changes check the deveopment branch. 

## Installation
### For Docker Users:
Nuxt.js the frontend of this application currently has issues running its dev server inside a docker container [See Here](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/4543).

Luckily there is no extra setup required to connect between the backend api and Nuxt running uncontainerized on your development machine. 


### Step 1 
Clone the repository to your local machine, install necessary dependencies and start the dev server.

Make sure the API is already running on your machine so that the application can utialize its data. 
```
git clone git@github.com:ko1eda/e-commerce-client.git

npm install 

npm run dev 
```
